# cardio-respiratory
Various Python/R/bash tools for analyzing cardio-respiratory time-series data

## Release notes and comments

This is "catch-all" repository for scripts and programs that we use in our laboratory for analyzing time-series data. 
The kinds of signals we typically analyze with these tools include:
- Electrocardiogram (ECG) for heart-rate variability
- Plethysmography data (detection of breaths, apneas, etc.)
- Neural activity measured with extracellular electrodes (cuff, hook, glass, metal, MEAs)

These tools will likely need tweaking and validation for your particular analysis protocol.
